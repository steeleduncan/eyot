# Eyot documentation

⚠ NB this documentation is out of date and I am currently updating it ⚠ 

This document is a rough guide to the Eyot programming language.
It is designed as a tutorial, but given the experimental nature of Eyot I've tried to explain why I've made certain choices rather than just document what i've done.

Although I have occasionally indicated where something is not in its final form, I've resisted the temptation to make this a list of TODOs.
It is a description of the language as it exists today, and as such the omission of some feature does not mean that I don't intend to implement it, just that I haven't done it yet.
Or I did it, and forgot to document it, in which case, please let me know.
