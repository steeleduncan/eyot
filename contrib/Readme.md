This has miscellaneous useful files

- `DEBIAN`: the root folder used for building the `.deb`
- `env.sh`: This is for setting up a development environment. If you `source contrib/env.sh` from the root of the repo, it will add `eyot` into your path. This is a command that builds and runs the latest sources rather than installing the binary
- `eyot-mode.el`: A minimal Emacs mode for Eyot
